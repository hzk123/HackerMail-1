# HackerMail

## Introduction
This Android app is designed for engineers who are too busy to send an email for various reasons.

For example: send emails to their wives and/or husbands when they might be home late for reason ''you can't say''.

By creating templates for different topics, each mail will automatcially choose a template as mail body and send to target mail address.
